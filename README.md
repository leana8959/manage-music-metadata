# manage-music-metadata

## Why
It's always been a pain for me to manage the metadata of my music files. There are GUI softwares like Mp3tag and many more that can achieve this, but they are not versatile enough.
i.e. I would like to have `1` instead of `01` as track number, yet I prefer the latter for file names so that my files are lined-up in a file manager.
I want to simply be able to run a command, go to sleep and wake up having all of my file names formatted and track number normalized in such a way.

## How
### Modes
These modes are currently available:
 - normalize-tracknumber
 - rename
 - normalize-year
 - set-genre
 - clear-comment
 - remove-junk
 - clear-lyrics
 
There's also the `--run` flag. Nothing is saved to the disk by default to avoid unwanted irreversable changes.
